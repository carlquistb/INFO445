# supporting information

T-SQL is a language that is built on a series of frameworks. It is used specifically to work with the SQL Server software solutions. T-SQL is built with:

- Structured Query language
- Set theory
- Relational Algebra

As we move into the specifics of T-SQL, you will begin to find differences between the workings of this language and the workings of other languages, such as those supporting MySQL, PostGRE, etc. Optimizations that we discuss may not apply in other software solutions.

## Set Theory

If you have been trained as a procedural programmer, this will not be intuitive to you. This is an alternative to iterative thinking; In set theory operations are performed on an entire *set* of data at once. In procedural programming, we are able to assume that an operation moves from a piece of data to the next in a known order; In set theory, we see performance boosts due to parallel processing, but we are unable to assume the order at which the operation moves between data points.
