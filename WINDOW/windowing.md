## Set Theory

If you have been trained as a procedural programmer, this will not be intuitive to you. This is an alternative to iterative thinking; In set theory operations are performed on an entire *set* of data at once. In procedural programming, we are able to assume that an operation moves from a piece of data to the next in a known order; In set theory, we see performance boosts due to parallel processing, but we are unable to assume the order at which the operation moves between data points.
